        I hold a postgraduate degree in Electronics Engineering and accumulated 14 years of professional experience in a research and development organization in India. In the year 1999, I made the decision to take Volunteer Retirement and subsequently migrated to the USA in 2000.

     <p>
Four years after our relocation, my family and I purchased our first home. Recognizing the advantages of real estate investment, we promptly seized opportunities to diversify our portfolio in the real estate market.
</p>
<p>

Having witnessed the fluctuations in the real estate sector, we adeptly navigated the market dynamics to our advantage. Additionally, we have actively encouraged and guided many of our friends to make informed decisions when purchasing their first or subsequent homes.
</p>
<p>
Drawing from our experiences, we are eager to share our insights and expertise with anyone interested in venturing into the realm of real estate investment.</p>
